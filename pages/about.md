I am a Software Engineer graduated from the Instituto Tecnológico de Mérida in Mexico, and my passion lies in creating software. Whether it's for open-source projects or personal use, I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies that enable me to embark on intriguing projects.

Primarily, I specialize as a Backend developer with proficiency in Java, Go, PHP, and JavaScript. Additionally, I possess intermediate skills in frontend development, utilizing HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, and various development frameworks.

I have a profound love for reading, whether it's novels, textbooks, or anything that piques my interest. My favorite author is Gabriel García Márquez; I am captivated by his novels.

I am deeply passionate about the exhilarating activities of running and mountain biking. Living amidst the stunning landscapes of California, I find endless joy in immersing myself in the great outdoors and embarking on thrilling adventures.
